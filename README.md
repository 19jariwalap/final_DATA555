My current project analyzes postpartum PFAS exposure and its association
with postpartum cardiometabolic risk factors including hemoglobin-A1C
levels, blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose levels. A targeted
method was implemented to screen PFAS concentrations in the cohort.
Descriptive statistics were implemented on different PFAS and their
concentrations where geometric mean and geometric standard deviation
were calculated. Descriptive statistics are also provided for the
postpartum cardiometabolic risk factors including hemoglobin-A1C levels,
blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and glucose levels. For context,
PFAS donâ€™t always exist individually but can also exist as a mixture of
different PFAS causing postpartum complications.1 Furthermore, Bayesian
kernel machine regression (BKMR) was implemented for estimating a PFAS
mixtures effect on postpartum cardiometabolic risk factors.
